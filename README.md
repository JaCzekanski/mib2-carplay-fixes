# MIB2 High Android Auto Virtual Cockpit

This project aims to finish what VW started. To bring Navigation and music information from AndroidAuto to the VW Virtual Cockpit.

> [!NOTE]
> This project does not support Car Play. Contributions for Car Play support are very much welcome.

## Features
- [X] Navigation directions
- [X] Distance to next maneuver
- [ ] ~~ETA and arrival time~~ (Not possible since it is not exposed from AndroidAuto)
- [X] Current title information
  - [X] Title
  - [X] Album
  - [X] Artist
  - [X] Cover art
  - [ ] Show which app is currently playing music
- [ ] Prevent forcing navigation view when navigation starts (I donÂ´t yet know if it is possible)
- [ ] Imperial units (contributions welcome)


> This project does not aim to render google maps from android auto in the VC. Refer to good folks over in [this issue](https://github.com/jilleb/mib2-toolbox/issues/159)
